# Running Locally 
1. Click the big green button that says "Code" either download the ZIP file or clone the repo. 
2. Download python if it's not already on your system
3. Enter the repo on your terminal( a combo of `cd` and `ls -al` will get you there) and run `pip install pipreqs`
4. Do python iggyBot.py and if it runs without errors you are good.
