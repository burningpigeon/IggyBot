SOTC's bot for submitting herbs and prey and eventually some misc staff stuff 

# Running Locally 
1. Click the big green button that says "Code" either download the ZIP file or clone the repo. 
2. Download python if it's not already on your system
3. Enter the repo on your terminal( a combo of `cd` and `ls -al` will get you there) and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. run `pip install py-cord`
5. Do python iggyBot.py and if it runs without errors you are good.
  
**NOTE:** The other file you need for the google API access and the bot token are in #techinal in the thread "prey/herb submission bot" in the pins
